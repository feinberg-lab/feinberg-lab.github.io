          <p>The NexGen 7 Tesla scanner has been developed at Berkeley in collaboration with Siemens and MR CoilTech LTD to improve the spatial resolution of MRI. The scanner was designed for ultra-high resolution (mesoscale) human brain research at up to 10 times more detail than current 7T scanners and over 50 times more detail than current 3T scanners. The scanner is described in a paper published in Nature Methods, December 2023, showing technical details and examples of the scanner dramatically improving resolution in functional MRI (fMRI) by achieving  0.4 millimeter resolution compared to the 2 - 3 millimeters typical of today's standard 3T scanners.  The NexGen 7T scanner was innovated under the NIH BRAIN Initiative as a new tool that allows studying brain circuitry underlying different diseases of the brain with high spatial resolution in fMRI, diffusion and structural imaging.  Therefore, the scanner performs human neuroscience research at higher granularity and contributes to putting UC Berkeley at the forefront of human brain research with MRI.</p>

          <p>To reach ultra-high resolution the scanner required making several advances in hardware. To improve spatial encoding and increase the image SNR, we developed with Siemens a head-only asymmetric gradient coil, Impulse gradient (200 mT/m, 900 T/m/s) with an innovative third layer of windings which gives an additional degree of freedom to minimize vibrations, acoustic noise and peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS). The scanner has integrated a 128-channel receiver system with 64- and 96-channel receiver coil arrays to boost signal in the brain cortex close to the coil array while reducing g-factor noise to enable higher accelerations for faster imaging. A 16-channel transmit system reduced power deposition and improved image uniformity. The scanner routinely performs functional imaging studies at 0.35–0.85 mm isotropic spatial resolution to reveal cortical layer functional activity, and achieves unprecedented high resolution in human brain functional imaging at 7T.</p>

          <p>The NexGen 7T system currently has the highest-performance head gradients in a human 7T MRI scanner, creating a new operating regime for functional MRI and diffusion MRI. The scanner routinely performs functional imaging studies at 0.35–0.85 mm isotropic spatial resolution to reveal cortical layer functional activity, and achieves unprecedented high resolution in human brain functional imaging at 7T.</p>

          <div class="gold-divider-sm"></div>

          <p>Emerging results on the NexGen 7T show that combining ultra-high field strength with high-performance gradients improves SNR efficiency and enables simultaneous gains in both spatial and angular resolution of diffusion imaging beyond current state-of-the-art 3T diffusion scanners and 7T scanners. By optimizing the hardware of the NexGen 7T scanner with high-performance gradients and larger receiver arrays, the new diffusion encoding regimes yield substantial gains in tractography fidelity and microstructural specificity beyond what is achievable on current state-of-the-art 3T and 7T scanners. The NexGen 7T scanner achieves robust mapping of human brain connectivity and microstructure at spatial and biophysical scales critical to the study of neural circuitry and disease.</p>
